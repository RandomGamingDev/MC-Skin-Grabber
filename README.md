# MC-Skin-Grabber
A simple, static, FOSS webpage for grabbing the skins of Minecraft players!

The API used for grabbing skins is the [Minotar API](https://minotar.net/)! This is due to CORS restrictions (which can't be bypassed due to this being a static site) which itself is due to Mojang not adding CORS compatibility to their site. (btw if some cool Mojang employee is somehow, somewhere reading this, plsssss allow CORS on your site)

Note: If the person isn't found it just returns a Steve skin lol (Totally intended feature)
